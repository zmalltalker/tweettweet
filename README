TweetTweet is a cocoa client for Twitter. It is created by Matt Legend Gemmell, and originally hosted with Bazaar on launchpad (see CREDITS for details).
This git repo will be updated with the latest changes from the original code, but modifications will be made here too.

To build the application, open TweetTweet.xcodeproj in XCode and build. You will need the Growl framework (available from http://growl.info/downloads_developers.php): put the Growl.framework into either ~/Library/Frameworks/ og /Library/Frameworks - and you should be good to go.
